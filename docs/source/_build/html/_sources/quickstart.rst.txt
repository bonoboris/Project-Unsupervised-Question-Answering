Installation
============

Dependencies
------------
UQA depends on the following libraries:

* `Click <https://palletsprojects.com/p/click/>`_: A framework for writing command line interfaces.
* `spaCy <https://spacy.io/>`_: An easy to use Natural language processing (NLP) framework
  mantaining recent pre-trained models for various language.
* `colorama <https://pypi.org/project/colorama/>`_: Cross-platform library for colorized console outputing.
* `Benepar <https://pypi.org/project/benepar/>`_: A multilingual constituency parser library that integrates with spaCy and NLTK

.. warning::
   
   * ``Benepar`` requires `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_ and `NumPy <https://numpy.org/>`_ to be installed prior to installing the library
   * ``Benepar`` depends on ``tensorflow`` but isn't compatible with ``tensorflow>=2.0`` at the time of writing 

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

* `ujson <https://pypi.org/project/ujson/>`_: A fast JSON encoder/decoder library

Installation with tensorflow==1.X
---------------------------------

Install ``numpy`` and ``Cypthon``::

    $ pip install numpy Cython

Install ``tensorflow<2.0``::

    $ pip install tensorflow==1.15

Install the **uqa** package,
in the project root directory::

    $ pip install .

**or** in editable mode::

    $ pip install -e .

Installation with tensorflow==2.X
---------------------------------
Follow the previously descibeb steps but install whatever version of ``tensorflow==2.X`` 
you want to use.

After the **uqa** package installation find the file ``benepar/base_parser.py`` in your
python site-packages directory and edit the first line from::
    
    import tensorflow as tf

to::

    import tensorflow.compat.v1 as tf

and save.

Installation with GPU support
-----------------------------
Both ``SpaCy`` and ``Benepar`` support GPU acceleration.
Refer to their documentation to enable GPU support for this package.
